- Last update : 2023/07/11
- There are 2 parts of the BOM. The requirement parts and option parts. 
- You can go with just requirement parts and keep the cost as low as possibe(about $100) or go a little fancy upgrade options parts(about $250 total).
- ~~I will try to work with vendors to make upgrade kit if the demands are high enough.~~ Frame kit will be made :)
- Fasteners are auto generated from the assembly CAD. If you spot any problem, please report in our discord.
